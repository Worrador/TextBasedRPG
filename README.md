# OpenWorld

This project for me served the purpose of learning modern c++ features in-depth. The game is a command-line based RPG, which the player can play using only the keyboard.
The game parses the data stored in different excel files (for ease of modification) and generates a random world.

Inside this world, the player can explore new places, kill enemies, collect items and gold and level their character. In order to do this, the player needs to manage their life and stamina as well. They only have one life, when they die, the next game will be completely different.
