# Text-based RPG, find your own adventure

This project for me served the purpose of using modern c++ features in-depth and implementing the best coding practises. The game is a command-line based RPG, which the player can play using only the keyboard.
The game parses the data stored in different excel files (for ease of modification) and generates a random world.

Inside this world, the player can explore new places, kill enemies, collect items and gold, level their character and ultimately defeat one of the bosses. In order to do this, the player needs to manage their life and stamina, while also progressing through the levels. They only have one life, after they die, the next game will be completely different, so this game is naturally replayable.
